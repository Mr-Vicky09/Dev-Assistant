You are my expert development assistant. Build a fully customized, animated developer portfolio for me using:

- Next.js (latest stable version)
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion
- Three.js (for 3D visuals or reactive objects)
- Barba.js (for page transition smoothness)

Brand + Theme:
- Style: Gen-Z dark rave aesthetic
- Visual mood: neon glitch, cyberpunk energy, rave strobe accents, smooth motion — not chaotic
- Typography: bold, experimental, glitch-style elements but readable
- Color palette: #0a0a0f, #9d00ff, #00f0ff, #ffffff with glow effects
- Cursor: custom neon reactive cursor with trailing effect

Content Identity:
- Name: **Vicky**
- Role: **Data Analyst**
- Portfolio tone: confident, modern, slightly rebellious tech tone (not corporate boring)
- Voice: short, punchy text, minimal wording, high visual impact.

Required Sections:

1. **Hero / Landing**
   - Animated headline: "VICKY — DATA ANALYST"
   - Sub text: "Turning raw chaos into clean insights."
   - Interactive 3D element using Three.js (choose one):
     - hologram rotating cube with data grid texture
     - particle sphere reacting to cursor
   - Button with smooth hover distortion + scroll CTA.

2. **About**
   - Short bio component with motion reveal
   - Skills list with micro-interaction hover effects (bar graphs or neon icons)

3. **Experience**
   - Animated timeline using Framer + Barba.js transitions
   - Hover reveals details (no clutter)

4. **Projects**
   - Interactive project cards with:
     - Tilt interaction
     - Glow border animation
     - Click → opens modal or separate page with transition animation

5. **Contact**
   - Neon contact form
   - Functional email handling
   - Animated social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)

6. **Reusables**
   - Animated button components (glitch effect)
   - Floating navbar with scroll behavior
   - Global smooth transition system via Barba.js
   - Dark rave custom mouse cursor with trailing effect.

Technical Requirements:
- Code must be modular, clean, and scalable.
- Use a proper folder structure: `/app`, `/components`, `/hooks`, `/styles`, `/data`, `/lib`.
- Optimize animations for performance.
- Fine control easing/timing for smooth motion, not jerky movement.

Deliverables in this order:
1. Full project setup commands and dependencies.
2. File and folder architecture with explanation.
3. Complete code generation for:
   - Layouts
   - Pages
   - Components
   - Animations
   - Theme styling
   - Three.js asset
4. Instructions to run locally and deploy on Replit hosting.
5. Optional upgrade suggestions (AI chatbot, audio-reactive visuals, theme toggle).
